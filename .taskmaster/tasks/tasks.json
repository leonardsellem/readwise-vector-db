Prometheus stubs\n   • Inside tests/_stubs/prometheus.py create a dummy CollectorRegistry subclass that overrides register() and returns silently when the collector is already present to avoid \"Duplicated timeseries in CollectorRegistry\" errors raised when Instrumentator().instrument() is executed in multiple tests.\n   • Patch prometheus_fastapi_instrumentator.Instrumentator in conftest.py so that its expose(app) method adds a ``/metrics`` route returning an empty 200 OK text/plain response.\n\n3. Health endpoint helpers\n   • Mock AsyncSession.exec to return an object whose first() or one() yields 1, satisfying the database probe inside /health implemented in Task-12.\n\n4. Parametrised fixtures\n   • Ensure default TestClient (sync) and AsyncClient (httpx.AsyncClient) fixtures are available for synchronously and asynchronously exercising endpoints.  \n   • Provide a registry.clean() autouse fixture that clears global prometheus_client state between tests.\n\n5. CI friendliness\n   • Guarantee that new stubs importable via ``from tests.stubs import ...`` so that other tests use a single source of truth.\n   • Run ``poetry run ruff tests`` and ``mypy --strict tests`` to keep stubs type-safe.\n",

Introduce a new settings key `DEPLOY_TARGET` (choices: \"docker\", \"vercel\") and `DB_BACKEND` (choices: \"local\", \"supabase\") in config.py using Pydantic-v2 `BaseSettings` so values can come from env vars, .env files or Vercel/Supabase project secrets.\n2. Refactor db/__init__.py so that it builds `DATABASE_URL` like:\n   ```python\n   def database_url(settings):\n       if settings.DB_BACKEND == \"supabase\":\n           return settings.SUPABASE_DB_URL  # postgresql://...supabase.co:6543/db?options=project%3D...\n       return settings.LOCAL_DB_URL  # existing docker-compose URL\n   ```\n   Keep pool size small (≤5) for serverless.\n3. Add `.env.supabase.example` and update `.env.example` with new keys. Document how to obtain the Supabase connection string and how to set `pgvector` extension using the SQL editor (`create extension if not exists vector;`).\n4. Migrations: add a `scripts/run_migrations_supabase.sh` that runs `alembic upgrade head` against the remote database. Mention rate limits & connection pooling (use pgbouncer).  Supabase already ships with Postgres ≈14 so pgvector 0.5+ is available.\n\nVercel deployment\n5. Add `vercel.json`:\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"buildCommand\": \"poetry install --no-root --sync && poetry run alembic upgrade head\",\n     \"outputDirectory\": \".vercel_build_output\",\n     \"routes\": [\n       {\"src\": \"/(.*)\", \"dest\": \"api/main.py\"}\n     ],\n     \"env\": {\n       \"DB_BACKEND\": \"supabase\",\n       \"SUPABASE_DB_URL\": \"@supabase_db_url\",\n       \"OPENAI_API_KEY\": \"@openai_api_key\"\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n6. Wrap the ASGI app with `asgi-lifespan` & `asyncpg.Pool` so cold-start time < 1 s on Vercel.  Provide `vercel_build.sh` that copies static files and ensures `python -m pip cache dir` is respected for speed.\n\nCI / CD\n7. Extend `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (from Task-14) with another matrix axis `deploy_target` (docker|vercel).  The vercel job:\n   • Installs Vercel CLI (`npm i -g vercel@latest`).\n   • Runs `vercel build --prebuilt` to verify configuration.\n   • Fails fast if build > 90 s or memory > 1024 MB.\n8. Add a reusable GitHub Action `vercel-deploy.yml` (workflow-dispatch) that publishes to Vercel Production when a semver tag is pushed.  Secrets required: `VERCEL_ORG_ID`, `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID`, `VERCEL_TOKEN`.\n\nDocumentation\n9. Update README Quick-Start with two new sections: “Using Supabase Cloud” and “Deploy to Vercel in 3 commands”.  Ensure code-blocks are copy-pasteable and lint-free.\n10. Provide an architecture diagram (drawioPNG) showing Docker vs Vercel/Supabase paths.\n\nBackward compatibility / safety\n11. Default values keep existing Docker + local Postgres path working.  Unit tests should cover both code paths.\n12. Fail fast if `DB_BACKEND=supabase` but `SUPABASE_DB_URL` undefined.\n",
        "testStrategy": "1. Unit tests:   \n   a. Parametrise `DB_BACKEND` fixtures (\"local\", \"supabase\").  Assert that `database_url()` resolves correctly and that `asyncpg.connect(url)` succeeds using `pytest-postgresql` for local and a dockerised supabase/postgres14 image for remote.  \n   b. With `DEPLOY_TARGET='vercel'` ensure `Settings().is_serverless` flag true and pool size == 1.\n2. Migration test: Spin up a Supabase container (`supabase/postgres`) via `testcontainers` and run `scripts/run_migrations_supabase.sh`; query `pg_extension` for `vector` and ensure all tables/indices present.\n3. End-to-end:   \n   • `make dev-supabase` launches API locally pointed at the Supabase container; send `/health` request → 200.  \n   • Repeat with default docker compose (`make dev`) to ensure nothing regresses.\n4. CI dry-run: `act -j build` runs the updated workflow; assert that both matrix jobs finish successfully and artefact `vercel-build.tar.gz` exists for the vercel leg.\n5. Manual smoke test: Push a branch to GitHub with `[preview]` in commit message; verify that the preview URL returned by Vercel shows Swagger UI and `/search?q=hi` responds 200.\n",

Bucket definition\n   core_modules = [\"readwise_vector_db/core\", \"readwise_vector_db/db\", \"readwise_vector_db/models\"]\n   hp_modules   = [\"readwise_vector_db/api\", \"readwise_vector_db/jobs\"]\n   std_modules  = [\"readwise_vector_db/mcp\", \"readwise_vector_db/cli\", \"readwise_vector_db/config\"]\n   Place this mapping in tools/coverage_buckets.py so it can be imported by both the checker script and docs.\n\n3. Checker script\n   • Create tools/check_coverage.py that:\n     a) Reads the coverage JSON produced by `coverage json -o .coverage.json` (add this command after pytest run).\n     b) Aggregates executed_line/num_lines for every file, then sums per bucket.\n     c) Asserts bucket coverages ≥ 100/85/70 respectively.\n     d) Prints a coloured summary and exits non-zero if any bucket misses its target.\n   • Implementation tip:\n     ```python\n     from pathlib import Path\n     import json, sys\n     from buckets import core_modules, hp_modules, std_modules\n\n     THRESHOLDS = {\n         \"core\": 1.00,\n         \"high\": .85,\n         \"std\":  .70,\n     }\n\n     data = json.load(open('.coverage.json'))\n     def pct(cov):\n         return cov['executed_lines'] / cov['num_lines'] if cov['num_lines'] else 1\n     bucket_cov = {k:{'executed':0,'total':0} for k in THRESHOLDS}\n     for file, cov in data['files'].items():\n         p = Path(file)\n         for bucket, roots in [('core',core_modules),('high',hp_modules),('std',std_modules)]:\n             if any(str(p).startswith(r) for r in roots):\n                 bucket_cov[bucket]['executed'] += len(cov['executed_lines'])\n                 bucket_cov[bucket]['total'] += cov['summary']['num_statements']\n                 break\n     failed = False\n     for b, s in bucket_cov.items():\n         c = s['executed']/s['total'] if s['total'] else 1\n         print(f\"{b}: {c:.1%} (target {THRESHOLDS[b]*100:.0f}%)\")\n         if c < THRESHOLDS[b]:\n             failed = True\n     sys.exit(1 if failed else 0)\n     ```\n\n4. CI updates (modify workflow added in Task 14)\n   • After `pytest` step:\n       - `coverage json -o .coverage.json`\n       - `python tools/check_coverage.py`\n   • Keep the overall `coverage xml` step so Codecov (or badge) continues to work, but drop the global `fail-under` flag.\n   • Update matrix jobs to call the checker script.\n\n5. Developer ergonomics\n   • Add Makefile target `make cov` running tests + checker.\n   • Pre-commit optional hook executing the same.\n\n6. Documentation\n   • docs/testing.md: explain rationale, list buckets & thresholds, describe how to run coverage locally.\n   • CHANGELOG entry highlighting that 100 % coverage is now mandatory for core logic and that the previous 90 % rule was removed.\n\n7. Cleanup\n   • Delete obsolete perf suite assertion in Task 15 if it hard-codes 90 %; instead, have it rely on the new script.\n   • Ensure scripts work on Windows paths (use Path().as_posix()).\n<info added on 2025-06-25T12:05:29.414Z>\n• Removed the global “fail_under = 90” line and all `omit = …` exclusions from .coveragerc so every module (including jobs/, models/, core/readwise.py, db/upsert.py) is now measured. Added a comment noting that thresholds are enforced by tools/check_coverage.py.\n\n• Added tools/coverage_buckets.py defining:\n  core_modules = [\"readwise_vector_db/core\", \"readwise_vector_db/db\", \"readwise_vector_db/models\"]\n  hp_modules   = [\"readwise_vector_db/api\", \"readwise_vector_db/jobs\"]\n  std_modules  = [\"readwise_vector_db/mcp\", \"readwise_vector_db/cli\", \"readwise_vector_db/config\"]\n  All paths are normalised with Path(...).as_posix() for cross-platform use.\n\nNext: import this mapping in the upcoming checker script and update the CI workflow to drop the legacy fail-under flag.\n</info added on 2025-06-25T12:05:29.414Z>\n<info added on 2025-06-25T12:08:56.156Z>\nStep 3 delivered:\n\n• tools/coverage_buckets.py and tools/check_coverage.py are committed and verified locally.  \n• .coveragerc cleaned; Makefile target make cov works end-to-end.\n\nObserved local coverage (pytest && make cov):\n  – core bucket: 70.5 % < 100 %  \n  – high-priority: 59.5 % < 85 %  \n  – standard: 82.7 % ≥ 70 %\n\nAs expected, the checker exits non-zero; CI will therefore fail until the workflow is updated and missing tests are added.\n\nFollow-up actions\n\n1. CI integration (next sub-task)\n   • Edit .github/workflows/python-tests.yml  \n       – remove any --cov-fail-under / fail_under lines  \n       – after pytest, add:\n           coverage json -o .coverage.json\n           python tools/check_coverage.py\n       – keep coverage xml for Codecov step.\n   • Ensure the matrix jobs call the new commands.\n\n2. Coverage remediation\n   • Raise coverage in core/ and jobs/ modules to satisfy new thresholds before enabling required-status checks.\n\n3. Docs / CHANGELOG\n   • Add section to docs/testing.md describing make cov and the new per-bucket enforcement.  \n   • Note rule change in upcoming release notes.\n\nAssign CI update to next sprint owner; open separate task for test-gap filling once hotpaths are identified.\n</info added on 2025-06-25T12:08:56.156Z>\n<info added on 2025-06-25T12:10:21.660Z>\nImplementation complete:\n\n• Tooling – coverage_buckets.py and check_coverage.py merged to main; `.coveragerc` trimmed; Makefile `cov` target operational.  \n• CI – `.github/workflows/ci.yml` now generates `.coverage.json`, invokes the checker, and drops all `--cov-fail-under` flags; pipeline correctly fails when any bucket misses its target.  \n• Documentation – new docs/testing.md details tiered thresholds, local workflow, and migration from the global 90 % rule.  \n• Validation – local run confirms correct exit codes: core/high buckets currently below target, standard passes; coloured summary renders in both TTY and GitHub log.  \n\nPending follow-ups (spin off separate tasks):\n\n1. Add/expand tests in `readwise_vector_db/core`, `db`, `models`, and `jobs` to raise coverage to ≥100 % / 85 %.  \n2.
